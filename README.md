- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was an actual bug? 1947 when the Harvard Mark II computer was malfunctioning, technicians discovered that a moth had gotten trapped in one of the relays, causing the system failure. They taped the moth to the computer's logbook and noted it as the 'first actual case of a bug being found.' Thus, the term 'debugging' was born!
